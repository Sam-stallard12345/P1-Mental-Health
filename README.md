# P1-Mental-Health

<h1>ClearSpace</h1>

This is my first independent project as part of the Code Institute 16 week bookcamp. In this I aim to Design a cohesive one-page layout website with a main navigation menu and structured content using HTML with CSS and Bootstrap.

By providing accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health and creating a welcoming webpage we can direct users toward our CTA: Sign up.

<h3> Color Scheme </h3>#

 For the color I chose a calming color palette suitable for mental health (e.g., pastels, blues, and greens).Ensured text met WCAG contrast standards with tools like Contrast Checker.

Used Iconify to generate the icon
