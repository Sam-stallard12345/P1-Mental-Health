# P1-Mental-Health

<h1>ClearSpace</h1>

This is my first independent project as part of the Code Institute 16 week bookcamp. In this I aim to Design a cohesive one-page layout website with a main navigation menu and structured content using HTML with CSS and Bootstrap.

By providing accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health and creating a welcoming webpage we can direct users toward our CTA: Sign up.

External User’s Goal: The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.

Site Owner’s Goal: The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.

<h2> Features </h2>

<h3> Color Scheme </h3>#

 For the color I chose a calming color palette suitable for mental health (e.g., pastels, blues, and greens).Ensured text met WCAG contrast standards with tools like Contrast Checker.

Used Iconify to generate the icon


<h3> Hero Image and Tagline </h3>

Hero Section with Positive Messaging: A Bootstrap Jumbotron with an encouraging message about mental health, using a calming colour scheme and a simple background image.


<h3> Articles and Resources Section</h3>

Created an Articles section with a grid or list layout of articles (e.g., title, short description, and “Read More” link). Semantic HTML elements like
and. Styled with CSS for a clean, organized look and ensured text content is easy to read with sufficient contrast.

<h3> Testimonials </h3>
Created a Testimonials section using
and "section" and "blockquote". Added placeholder testimonials styled with CSS (e.g., card layout or sliders). 

<h3> Sign up Page </h3>
The Sign Up page includes a form where users can enter their details to create an account. The form captures essential information such as name, email, and password. Additionally, an embedded iframe is used to direct user to a wellness centre nearby they can use their memberships for discounts with.

<h2> Known Bugs </h2>
<li> Responsive Design Issues: Initially, the layout was not responsive on smaller screens. This was fixed by adjusting the media queries and ensuring all elements scaled properly.</li>
<li> Form Validation Errors: The sign-up form was not validating user inputs correctly. This was resolved by adding proper HTML5 validation attributes and JavaScript checks.</li>
<li> Broken Links: Some internal links were broken due to incorrect file paths. This was corrected by updating the paths to match the project structure.</li>
<li> CSS Styling Conflicts: There were conflicts between custom CSS and Bootstrap classes. This was fixed by using more specific selectors and avoiding overrides of Bootstrap styles.</li>
<li> Image Loading Issues: Some images were not loading due to incorrect file paths or missing files. This was resolved by verifying the paths and ensuring all images were in the correct directory.</li>
<li> Accessibility Problems: The initial design did not meet WCAG standards. This was addressed by improving color contrast, adding alt text to images, and ensuring keyboard navigability.</li>

<h2> Future Feautures </h2>
<li> Make FAQ section interactive</li>
<li> Add some articles to a blog page </li>
