# P1-Mental-Health

<h1>ClearSpace</h1>

This is my first independent project as part of the Code Institute 16 week bookcamp. In this I aim to Design a cohesive one-page layout website with a main navigation menu and structured content using HTML with CSS and Bootstrap.

By providing accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health and creating a welcoming webpage we can direct users toward our CTA: download the app.
